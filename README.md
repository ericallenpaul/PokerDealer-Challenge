# Poker Dealer Challenge
In this challenge you are asked to complete the program by completing the Deck() constructor method and the DrawCard() method. This challenge relies heavily on the use of Lists<> and your knowledge of how to create and use them.

### Object Design
Think about a real deck of cards. How 
would you create a deck using code? What are the components 
of a deck? What are the components of a card?

Look carefully at the program’s design before you start to 
write your code. Look at all the classes and see if you can 
understand how the pieces fit together. Are there any 
existing methods that you might use?

Look also at the Main method of Program.cs. Look at the 
code and see if you can determine what it’s supposed to do.

### Challenge 1 – Complete the Deck’s Constructor 
The constructor method needs to return a fully populated 
deck of cards. They should be in order as if it were a fresh 
pack of cards straight from the box. Populate the deck of 
cards by adding them to the _cards global variable. 
When you think you’re code is correct run the program. 
Did it display the deck of cards as outlined in Program.cs?

### Challenge 2 – Complete the ``DrawCard()`` Method
Think about a physical deck of cards, if you were drawing 
cards from the deck you’d take the first one off the deck 
and hand it to a player. Once that card is handed off it’s 
no longer in the deck. How would you do the equivalent in 
code? (Remember your deck is stored in ``_cards``).
